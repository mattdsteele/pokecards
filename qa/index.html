<UL><LI>Well, the wording on the card is a little strange, "Put a Stage 2 card on top of a Basic Pokémon; you can't use this card unless you were allowed to evolve that Pokémon anyway." Well, let me give you an example. Say for your starting hand you have a squirtle, a blastoise, a breeder, and a few energies. You can lay down the Squirtle, but you can't evolve it using the breeder, because it's your first turn. On your second turn, you can use the breeder, put the Blastoise down, and put all the energies down (By the way, that is what Rain Dance decks are centered around.)</LI>
