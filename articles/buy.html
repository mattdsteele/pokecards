There are a few places on the Internet where you can buy P: TCG. I am in no way advertising these websites; I am just giving information to the people.<BR><TABLE BORDER="2" BGCOLOR="FFFFBB"><TD><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.wizards.com">Wizards of the Coast</A>-where I get most of my online cards at. Because they are the official provider, they sell every type of pack, and at the MSRP, too. Shipping is cheap, also.<LI>Online Auctions-I haven't used any of these sites to get cards, because I'm a little bit leery of using the 'Net as a way of auctioning. However, you can see some interesting things on them (such as someone paying $120 for a 1st Ed. Charizard). Here are three of the bigger ones:<BR><UL TYPE="square"><LI><A HREF="http://auctions.yahoo.com/17737633-category.html">Yahoo! Auctions</A>-Here is one well-known auction place. If you're looking for a certain card, you can usually find it for at least $5.00, or better.<LI><A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</A>-The best-known auction website. If you're looking for a card, look here first, because there are more people on it; hence lower prices.<LI><A HREF="http://www.tradebinder.com">Tradebinder</A>-My brother once sold his Vaporeon on this website, and he got his money in a week. The good thing about this site is that, unlike other auctions, Tradebinder acts as a middleman; ie: you send your card into Tradebinder, the other person sends their money into Tradebinder, then they send the card & money to them. It takes a little longer, but it is much safer; plus, Tradebinder specializes in TCG cards only.</UL></UL></TR></TD></TABLE>
