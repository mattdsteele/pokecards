<H2>Spare Pokémon</H2><BR>Like any other Pokemon trainer, you want to build up your Pokemon as much as you can. You want to give them all the Energy they need, heal them with potions whenever they get banged up, and do all sorts of other good, nurturing things for them. There's just one problem: You need cards to do all this, and you only draw a limited number of cards in any given game. If too many of the cards you draw are Pokemon, you just won't have the Energy to suppord them all. This means you'll have "spare" Pokemon that you can't afford to maintain. So the question then becomes, what do you do with all these spares? Well, what if you make one of the your Active Pokemon, don't put any Energy on it, and leave it out there to go down for the team?
Sounds cruel, but imagine that your starting hand contains Growlithe, whose attack takes 2 Energy, and its evolved for, Arcanine, whose atacks thake at least 3. Chances are you're starting with just enough Energy in your hand to power Arcanine's attacks-and this means that you have to treat all your other Pokemon as spares until you draw more Energy. Now you have to decide which Pokemon will be your starting Active Pokemon. If you chose Growlithe, it'll be two turns before it can attack; it'll be three turns before Arcanine can. If you're going first, that's not so bad, but if you're going second, three attacks by your opponent might be enough to Knock Out Growlithe. You'll have to evolve it on your second turn in order to get to Arcanine, so you can't attack until your third turn. By then, Arcanine will be so beat up that all the Energy you attached to it might last for only an attack or two.
A better idea, then, is to make one of your spare Pokemon your starting one. Leave that spare one out there for the couple of turns that it'll take to groom Arcanine properly, then either let that spare get Knocked Out or find some way to retreat it. Pokemon with retreat costs of 0 thent to have low Hit Points; they'll probably get Knocked Out before your main Pokemon is ready, but you might be able to cycle through several such weaker Pokemon as Active Pokemon until your main one's ready to fight. If your Active Pokemon has a retreat cost of 1 or more, it's rarely worth the sacrifice of an Energy card to retreat it on its own; if you can't use something like Switch, just let the Pokemon get Knocked Out. Yeah, having one of your Pokemon get Knocked Out that early in the game isn't so great, but it'll be worth it to have a fresh Arcanine rushing into the fight. Think of it as turning one of your spare Pokemon into a really big Potion for Arcanine, at the cost of leting those spares get Knocked Out while building up a better Pokemon.
Not surprisingly, there also will be many situations in the middle of games where it's reasonable to give up a spare Pokemon in order to save a more valuable one. Maybe the first Pokemon you built up has been Knocked Out, and it's time to build up a new one. Maybe that first Pokemon is Poisoned, maybe it already has lots of damage counters, whatever. Tucking that banged-up Pokemon onto your Bench clears any special conditinos on it and buys it time while you find some kind of potion to patch it up. Plus, by this point you've usually added Energy to a relatively unimportant Pokemon, so your "spare" can actually do some damage while you get ready to bring the more powerful one back out. Also, your opponent might do things to turn your favorite Pokemon into a spare one. Confusion is a particularly good for this, as it makes it difficult for you to attack with or retreat your Pokemon; you can't count on simply Benching it to get rid of the condition. In these cases it's often best to just let the Pokeom sit there while you groom its replacement. Even attacking with it is risky because it might attack itself by accident and eat into the time you ahve to build up the next one. As with most tactics, if you're planning to use this one often, you should devote some of the cards in your deck to pulling it off. Look for Pokemon with retreat costs of 0 or look for cards like Switch. Potions can help the spare Pokemon last longer, but usually you want to save those Trainer cards for the Pokemon you're grooming. Lots of the Pokemon Power are handy for this tactic, too. Alakazam lets you move damage counters around at will for free; so giving Alakazam two or three Pokemon with high Hit Points (like Onix or Chansey) to wirk with can let you stall forever. With Venusaur, you can give your spare Pokemon an energy card or two to attack with, then move those Energy cards of when that spare is about to be knocked out. With 90 Hit Points, Electrode can buy you some time and then give you an Energy boost when it comes time to bring in the new Pokemon. Yes, Electode's Knocked Out by doing this, but often you're planning to let your spare Pokemon get Knocked Out anyway-might as well get something more out of it! One final note: Don't be afraid to discard spare Pokemon when using cards like Energy Retrieval and Computer Search. If you don't need to have them in play, they really aren't doing any good in your hand. Most of the time you wild just draw more spare Pokemon before the Energy to build up new ones.<HR><a href="http://www.pokemonvillage.com/topsites"> <img src="http://www.pokemonvillage.com/topsites/topsites.asp?site=385" width=81 height=32 border=0> </a>
