Here they are:<BR><UL><LI><B>Haymaker</B>-The Haymaker has not been changed that much. There aren't very many cards that help the Haymaker (perhaps Aerodactyl), and none that hurt it, so it's (unfortunately) as strong as ever.<LI><B>Rain Dance</B>-The Rain Dance deck has been helped a little, but now there are decks to counter it. With the addition of Lapras and (more importantly) Articuno, the Raindance got some much-needed help. However, Aerodactyl (A pokemon that stops others from evolving) and Muk (Other Pokémon Powers can't be used) can stop Raindance dead in its tracks. I think the pros outweigh the cons, and the Raindance deck is a little better off now.<LI><B>Mr. Mime Stall</B>-I love playing this deck because everyone hates it. However, this deck only got one extra card: Tentacool. Why Tentacool? Just put him on your bench, load him up with damage swap, and use his power (a free Scoop Up) to get rid of all the damage. However, now that Muk is out, this fun deck may be eliminated.</UL><BR>So what do you do? The answer: <B>don't build any of these decks</B>. As Warhammer said, we need different decks to keep this game alive.<BR><BR>Comments? Questions?<BR><a href="mailto:chimpdude@hotmail.com">Chimpman</a></p>
