In the Pokemon CCG, you have that same option, but it's surprising how many people will just slap an evolved Pokemon on their Basaic Pokemon, without even thinking about it. Just as in the video game, evolving is not always a good idea.<BR>To understand why not to evolve, we first must understand why you evolve. Generally, an evolved Pokemon will have more hit points and more powerful attacks that its previous evolutionary form. But these abilities come at a price, and that price is a higher attack cost, either in Energy cards or some other cost, like discarding Energy or taking damage. That should be your first question when deciding whether or not to evolve a Pokemon: Can I pay for its attacks? A Pokemon that can't attack is almost always useless.<BR>One reason to evolve a Pokemon, when you can't pay for its attacks, is to obtain the powerful Stage 2 forms that trant a special Pokemon power into play. These Pokemon powers typically work even if the Pokemon has no Energy or is sitting on the bench. However, unless your deck relies on trickery to win (like the Alakazam/Chansey stall deck), eventually you'll probably want to get Energy on that Pokemon, to power its hefty attacks.<BR>The amount of Energy in your hand will usually determine when to evolve. If you only have one Energy in your hand, evolving a Pokemon to a form that has a four-Energy attack does you little good, as you won't be able to pay for its attacks. The general rule to follow is that you should only evolve your Pokemon when you have enough Energy in your hand to power its attacks (or possibly if you're one short and are fairly sure of getting an Energy soon). Remember, that each card in your hand is a precious resource that should not be spent unwisely. An evolved Pokemon that expires before it can attack enough Energy to attack is a wasted card.<BR>Strategies for evolution also vary depending on whenther you're trying to evolve your active Pokemon or a benched one. I rarely evolve my active Pokemon; by the time I get enough energy on him to mount an attack, he'll have fainted, or nearly so. Rather, I prefer to evolve a benched Pokemon in relative safety and be ready to go when I make him active. This may sometimes require the sacrifice of my active Pokemon, but it's usually an acceptable price.<BR>There are a few cases where you would want to evolve your active Pokemon. If my Pokemon is close to fainting, evolution can give it t he extra hit points that it needs to keep going (or in the case of Beedrill, it can retreat for free). Because this can be wasteful, if your Pokemon is going to faint anyway, you should only do this if it's your lasat Pokemon (in which case you've got nothing to lose) or if you can power the evolved Pokemon's attacks on this turn. Weedle/Kakuna/Beedrill is an example of a Pokemon trio that can evolve one stage on every turn and can attach one Energy, on each turn, and continue fighting. Also, evolution removes any bad statuses (Confusion, Sleep, Paralysis, Poison), so if you really need to fix up that active Pokemon and don't have a Full Heal handy, evolution might be your only choice. just keep an eye on what your opponent's next attack wil be. If your evolved Pokemon can't survive it any better that your non-evolved one, there's probably no reason to wasate the evolution card.<BR>The last reason not to evolve your Pokemon is a strategy that exists in every CCG-surprise. If you have two Squirtles and a Pikachu on your bench, your opponent won't know your true capabilities. Can you evolve them into Wartortle and Raichu? Or, are you stuck with Basick pokemon? Also if you evolve one of your two Squirtles and your opponent uses Gust of Wind, he can choose whether he wants to deal with a Squirtle or a Wartortle. If you don't evolve the Squirtle, his Gust will make one of them active, and then you're in control: Do you evolve the active Pokemon and give him a big surprise, or evolve the Squirtle on your bench and let him bide his time attaching Energy until he's ready to fight.<BR>Here is another strategy employing Gust of Wind: If your opponent has made the error of evolve his Pokemon too quickly, bring Gust of Wind into play before they can get Energy on their evoved Pokemon. In a recent tournament, my opponent evolved his Charmander into a Charizard, without putting any Energy on it. I quickly Gusted the Charizard and took it down in a few turns, before he could attach four Energy to it.<BR>The temptation to evolve can be strong (some would say even stronter than the dark side), but reckless evolution only leads to losing decks. Think it through, take your time, and weigh the positives and negatives before you make your move-that's good advice regarding any CCG.<HR><a href="http://www.pokemonvillage.com/topsites"> <img src="http://www.pokemonvillage.com/topsites/topsites.asp?site=385" width=81 height=32 border=0> </a>
