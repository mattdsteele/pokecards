One of the first things new Pokémon trainers have to learn is how to properly construct a deck using their Pokemon to maximum potential. There are a few key elements you need to keep in mind as you build your own Pokemon deck: First, come up with a theme for your deck. This will help you determine both its Energy composition and which Pokemon to include. Second, when you actually begin to build the deck, keep in mind the number of Energy cards, Pokemon, and Trainer cards This is vital information that will help you balace your deck. And when you're done, you'll have a solid deck you can use to challenge other Pokemon trainers on your way to becoming a Pokemon Master!<BR><H2>Theme</H2><BR>
What exactly do you want to accomplish with your Pokemon deck? Well, you need to decide, right from the beginning, its theme. Do you want to focus on a single Energy type? Are you interested in getting out a specific Pokemon to defeat your opponent? Whatever you've decided, the construction of your deck will hinge on this theme, and your theme will determine the cards we'll add to the deck. Let's create a deck from the ground up to better illustrate what to consider during deck construction.<BR>The theme of our deck is going to be based on getting out some highly evolved Pokemon. Let's start by using Machop and his evolutions, Machoke and Machamp. Machop is a pretty solid Fighting Pokemon, so we need to use Fighting Energy cards to power his abilities. Now, is all we want Fighting Energy? Maybe you like Charmander, which evolves into two pretty good Pokemon, Charmeleon and Charizard. Because Charmander is a Fire Pokemon, we also need to add Fire Energy cards to our deck. In general, don't build decks with more than two Energy types for now. By focusing on just two Energy types, we have access to a pretty solid array of things we can do, and we reduce the chance of getting stuck with Pokemon we can't use because we don't have the right Energy for them.<BR>Now we have a Fire/ Fighting deck that will focus on Machop, Cnarmader, and their respective evolutions. We could even come up with a nifty name to highlight our theme, maybe something like "Fire Fighters" or "The Pokemon Fire Department." Naming your deck can be a lot of fun, so make sure you get the most out of it!<BR><H2>Deck Construction</H2><BR>So you've begun to flesh yout your themed deck. What comes next? Including other Pokemon to support the ones you decided on during the theme state (of you chose a theme based on particular Pokemon) or lining up Pokemon in general that match your theme's goals. Also, you'll now consider Trainer cards to help your deck accomplish its goals. And finally, you'll now add the appropriate Energy cards to power your Pokemon, balancing the number of Energy cards if you deck uses more than one type of Pokemon.<BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="3"><TD COLSPAN="2"><FONT COLOR="red">The Pokémon Fire Fighers<TR><FONT COLOR="black"><TD>4X<TD>Charmander<TR><TD>2X<TD>Charmeleon<TR><TD>1X<TD>Charizard<TR><TD>4X<TD>Growlithe<TR><TD>2X<TD>Arcanine<TR><TD>4X<TD>Machop<TR><TD>2X<TD>Machoke<TR><TD>1X<TD>Machamp<TR><TD>2X<TD>Onix<TR><TD>2X<TD>Sandshrew<TR><TD>2X<TD>Energy Retrieval<TR><TD>3X<TD>Potion<TR><TD>2X<TD>Bill<TR><TD>16X<TD>Fire Energy<TR><TD>13X<TD>Fighting Energy<TR><TD COLSPAN="2"><HR><TR><TD>60<TD>TOTAL CARDS</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR>Using our example from above, we already have a fair idea of what we need to include in our deck. We're going to be using Fire and Fighting Pokemon, so we need to add the appropriate Energy (28 of our 60 cards is usually a good starting number of Energy cards). If your Pokemon use up Energy cards to power their attacks, you may want closer to 30 Energy cards. If you Pokemon don't need many Energy cards to power their attacks, you might be able to shave an Energy card or two from your total. Don't go with too few Energy cards, however, or you'll find yourself with Pokemon in play and no Energy to power them. For the deck we're making, let's go with 16 Fire Energy cards and 13 Fighting Energy cards-that's one more than 28 and balanced slightly toward Fire Energy because we use up Fire Energy cards to power Charmander's (and Charmeleon and Charizard's) attacks.<BR>It's time to add the Pokemon you'll need to get your theme up and running. When adding Pokemon, it's very important to remeber that you need Basic (non-evolved) Pokemon to get things started, so add plenty of basic Pokemon to your deck. Sixteen is a good number of Basic Pokemon to begin with, ensuring that you'll get at least one (and probably two) Basic Pokemon in your opening hand. From here, add various Evolution cards for the Basic Pokemon you already have in the deck.<BR>For the deck we're making, we know that we're including Machop and Charmander. We can only put for copies of a single card in our deck, we we should have four of each. (They're common cards, so they shouldn't be too hard to get, either by buying cards or trading for them.) We're also including the evolutions of these cards-after all, that's our theme! Because we can't play Evolution cards without the Basic Pokemon from which they evolve, we'll need less of those. A good measure to follow is "4-2-1" (4 Basic Pokemon, 2 Stage 1 Evolution cards, and 1 Stage 2 Evolution card) for Pokemon with two States and "4-2" (4 Basic Pokemon and 2 Stage 1 Evolution cards) for Pokemon with only one Stage. (These ratios can be halved if you want a smaller number of a particular Pokemon in your deck.) If rarities aren't a concern for you, you might try adding an additional Evolution Pokemon at all the stages, though you run a greater risk of halving the evolved Pokemon and not the basic one. For our deck, we'll follow "4-2-1" for both Machop and Charmander.<BR>We still need eight more Basic Pokemon to fill out our complement, so we'll divide them between the two Energy types. For Fighting, let's use Onix and Sandshrew, two off Each. For Fire let's try just Growlithe, four copies of it. Growlithe can evolve into Arcanine, so let's include two of those. If you don't care for these Pokemon, then try mixing and matching ones you like, so long as they are Basic Pokemon (and the appropriate ratio of evolutions if you want them). Also, you can use "colorless" or generic Energy Pokemon in these slots as they do not require specific Energy types to power their attacks. They tend to be a little weaker than Pokemon that are specific types, so be careful if you decide to use them.<BR>Our card count is now 53 cards out of 60-what do we do with the last 7 cards? Now we choose Trainer cards toa fill out our deck and provide some control over our theme. In general, Trainer cards are a great way to give your deck direction, especially in supporting the theme you choose. With our theme, Trainer cards can help us fill specific roles. First, we lose a fair number of Fire Energy cards by using those attacks that require us to discard a Fire Energy card. Energy Retrieval is a great tool for us to get back some of that Energy, so let's put two in our deck. Next, a little card drawing never hurts, especially if it puts a nice juicy Evolution card to put into play. Two Bills will help us out there. Finally, it's always a shame to lose a Pokemon because it takes too much damage. Potion is a nifty card that removes damage from a Pokemon; let's try three of them. Don't be afraid to intker with the specific Train cards in your deck if you prefer other cards. That's what deck construction is all about!<BR><H2>Wrapping it up</H2><BR>Guess what? You have a Pokemon deck! The theme we've been using is only an example of what you can do. Following these basic guidelines should help get you to where you need to be in order to build a deck of your likeing. Never be afraid to experiment by adding different Pokemon to the deck and taking out Pokemon that don't suit your needs. This is especially true for Trainer cards, as they should be chosen to help you accomplish your goals. Remeber the two key steps-coming up with a theme and then choosing cards to flesh out the teams-and you should have no trouble earning your badges. Good luck!<HR><a href="http://www.pokemonvillage.com/topsites"> <img src="http://www.pokemonvillage.com/topsites/topsites.asp?site=385" width=81 height=32 border=0> </a>
