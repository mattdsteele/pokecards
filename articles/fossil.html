now that fossil is out, I bet you are all drooling over the brand new cards...So
I decided to list some of the cards that are (in my opinion) the  best:
<ul>
<li>Geodude: This card has MAJOR damage potential (with luck).  Fighting
Type, Basic
Pokémon, 50 HP, Weakness Grass, one retreat...seems pretty
average.  But here's his awesome attack:  For one Fighting and one
colorless energy you flip a coin until it lands on tails.  The amount
of heads x 10 is the damage.  Get lucky, and this is one mean attack.</li>
<li>Aerodactyl:  Pokémon can't evolve?  Need I say more?</li>
<li>Magmar: Just a good basic, mean to use early in the game.</li>
<li>Muk:  Pokémon can't use their
Pokémon Powers?  Can we say anti-aerodactyl?</li>
<li>Mew:  De-evolution beam returns the topmost evolution to your
opponents hand?  For example, if a Gyrados had 30 damage, it would be
turned back into a Magikarp, and be K.O.'d!</li>
<li>Kabuto:  Let's you see your opponent's hand...wow!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the great cards in fossil...They could be different
in the American set, so watch out!</p>
