<FONT COLOR="FFBF7F" SIZE="4">Trainer Comments/Strategy:</FONT><BR>As you can see, this is a combination Haymaker (quick kill w/ Hitmonchan) deck combined with an Energy Denial deck. This allows for lightning-fast kills & works around stall decks with the Energy Removals & Dragonair's Hyper Beam. This is my best deck so far, and I have never been defeated with it (Except for once, when I ran out of cards). I have also included the Pokémon Flutes in there for a reason: All you have to do is kill someone w/ 40 or less HP, then use the Flute to send him back on the bench, and Gust him out. Then use Hitmonchan's Special Punch, and voila: you have another prize! The Bills & Oaks are there to ensure that you get the cards that you need, & the Farfetch'd are there to go up against Fighting (a commonly used type) Pokémon & for quick kills w/ the Leek Slap (if you're lucky). Other than that, this is pretty much self-explanatory.<BR><BR><A HREF="mailto:chimpdude@hotmail.com">Chimpman</A>
