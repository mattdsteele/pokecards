<FONT COLOR="FFBF7F" SIZE="4">Trainer Comments/Strategy:</FONT><BR>U-Gehirn, which means "Underwater Mind" in German, is designed to be a stall deck, but it can also be used as a fight to the finish deck. The Abra/Kadabra/Alakazams are here mainly because of 'Kazam's Damage Swap, the Jynxs are the only real Psychic fighters, so I included them. The Chanseys are there to take punishment & stall (put damage counters on them w/ Damage swap). I want to replace the Farfetch'ds with Mr. Mimes, but I only have one right now. The Wartortles & Blastoise are the main beat-down people in my deck, but I have noticed that the lowly Staryu has one of the best attacks in the game (20 damage for one water!). To make sure I get the cards I need, I put in the Trader. I also put in the routine 4 Energy Removals & 1 SER to help stall, the Full Heals are there in case 'Kazam or Blastoise get Poisoned, and the usual Super Potions.<BR><BR><A HREF="mailto:chimpdude@hotmail.com">Chimpman</A>
