<!--Make sure there are only 5 different updates on this page. If there's more, delete the bottom ones. Thanks: Chimpman--!>
<TD BGCOLOR="FFFFBB"><B>12/19/1999</B><TR><TD BGCOLOR="FFFFAA">(Updated by Chimpman)<BR>Well, Netscape users, rejoice. Although you probably have not been able to access the decks page since it opened, consider it usable. There was a problem with the HTML programming (thanks to Mr. Paranoid for pointing it out), and Netscape users couldn't read it. I don't use Netscape, so I never noticed it. Anyway, the deck page is up and ready. Be sure to send the decks in, oh faithful Netscape users.<BR><UL><LI><B>Base Set 2</B>-Well, I've got a short tidbit news flash for you. Wizards has found out how to get more of our money. Base set 2, a new expansion for P: TCG, will be released in the near future. (It's scheduled for March 2000, but you know how the dates change.) In it will be a collection of the first set (I just call it Base) and Jungle. Some cards will be left out, such as the Eevee family and the Oddish family from Jungle, plus a few basics from the Base set. To find out more about this, visit the <A HREF="http://www.pojo.com/Features/baseset2.html">Pojo's</A> page.</UL></LI><TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="FFFFBB"><B>12/17/1999</B><TR><TD BGCOLOR="FFFFAA">(Updated by Chimpman)<BR>Hey! I bet you thought I forgot about this page, right? Of course not! I just haven't had the time to update it, with school and finals and stuff like that going on. Anyway, I added another deck to the deck section, and that's all I can do for now. Send some more in, and I'll post them!<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="FFFFBB"><B>11/14/1999</B><TR><TD BGCOLOR="FFFFAA">(Updated by Chimpman)<BR>Well, I got some more decks in, so I posted them. Keep 'em coming!<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="FFFFBB"><B>11/12/1999</B><TR><TD BGCOLOR="FFFFAA">(Updated by Chimpman)<BR>Wow, it's been over a month since I last updated. You might want to know why. First of all, I'm not getting any e-mail. That means I can't add decks or anything else to my site. Second of all, I'm into my busy routine of high school. However, now that I have a free spare of time, I'll just update you on the news:<BR><UL><LI><B>Pokemon: the First Movie</B>-Well, I don't actually want to see this, but if you went on the first day, you can send in for one of four promo P: TCG cards. They are Dragonite, Mewtwo, Electabuzz, and Pikachu (how'd I guess?). They are selling on Ebay for up to $20 (and you get them w/ a $5 ticket.)<LI><B>P: TCG GB</B>-OK, this acronym for Pokémon: Trading card game for the Game Boy, just means that this game will come be released sometime next February. That means you don't have to lug all your cards with you wherever you go; just bust out your Game Boy! I know I'll be the first to buy this game.<LI><B>P: TCG League</B>-Be sure to join up with the Pokemon League; for you can get several promo cards this way. Some of them are: L16 Pikachu, Mew, Prerelease Clefable, Prerelease Aerodactyl, and more to be sure.</UL><BR>Well, that's all for now. Please send in those decks, and ta ta!<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="FFFFBB"><B>10/11/1999</B><TR><TD BGCOLOR="FFFFAA">(Updated by Chimpman)<BR>I finally finished the Jungle commons, and Warhammer & I are dilligently working on Fossil. Expect some parts of it to be up by next weekend. Anyway, 1st Edition Fossil cards are out, and that's about all the news I have to post. And that's all I have to say about that.<TR>
