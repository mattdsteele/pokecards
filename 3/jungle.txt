Notes:
The most current version of this list will be maintained at
http://pokegym.thedojo.com/

Energy Requirements and Costs have coded references (rather than the
symbols printed on the card).
Energy will be referenced as:  F (Fighting), R (Fire), G (Grass),
P (Psychic), W (Water), and L (Lighting). Colorless energy costs will
be designated with a numeral indicating the amount of colorless energy
required. (e.g.  3WW  indicates a cost of 3 colorless energy and 2
water energy)

Height and weight have NOT been included, but "Species" refers to the
Pokemon "type" given under the card picture.

Pokemon descriptions from the bottom of the card have NOT been
included, but Level and Pokemon Number from this same area have been
listed. (Do not confuse WotC Card Number with Pokemon Number.)
