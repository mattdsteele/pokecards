<BR><UL><LI><B>What does P: TCG stand for?</B><UL><LI>It stands for Pokemon: Trading Card Game. I hadn't seen anyone abbreviate it, so I did.</UL><BR><LI><B>Why are booster packs of the game so expensive?</B><UL><LI>Well, it all has to do with supply and demand. However, now that Wizards decided to make the cards a little cheaper in quality, it can sell more of them; there shouldn't be much of a problem finding them. The only reason I would see for the cards being more that $3.00 a pack would be if you lived in a small town. Where I live there was only one place that sold the cards. They charged over 4 dollars for each pack. However, another place sells them for $2.50 each, so the first store had to lower her prices to keep in business. Therefore, the more widely available, the lower the prices.</UL><BR><LI><B>I've heard of decks called "Haymaker", "Rain Dance", and "Unending Stall". What do these mean?</B><UL><LI>Well, each of these are a very popular type of deck theme. "Haymaker" is designed around Hitmonchan, Electabuzz, and Scyther for quick kills; "Rain Dance" is focused on getting a Blastoise out very fast, and "Unending Stall" focuses on Mr. Mime, Alakazam, and a Pokémon with a high HP to make your opponent "deck", or run out of cards. There are a series of checks and balances in this; i.e., if you play your cards right, Haymaker will beat Unending Stall, Rain Dance will beat Haymaker, and Unending Stall will beat Rain Dance.</UL><BR><LI><B>Why did you make this page?</B><UL><LI>I made this page for several reasons: I had nothing else to do on the Internet, I figured that if my site was good enough I could get a few sponsors and make a little money, and I wanted to help other people with P: TCG. I mean, Wizards of the Coast doesn't do anything to help you, just look at their FAQ! One of the questions is "What are all those numbers and symbols on the cards?" Come ON! Anyway, since the big website, the Pojo, doesn't seem to answer every single question, I decided to make a page where I will answer all your questions.</UL><HR><a href="http://www.pokemonvillage.com/topsites">
