If it says "Stage 2: Evolves from ____", you must lay it down on top of the Stage 1 Pokémon with ____'s name.<BR><LI><FONT COLOR="red" FACE="arial">Hit Points</FONT>-How much "life" your Pokémon has.

See "Weakness" for more information.<BR><LI><FONT COLOR="red" FACE="arial">Pokémon Data</FONT>-Just stuff from the Game Boy Pokédex. However, to the left of this stuff there will or won't be a stamp that says "Edition 1".

The text tell the name of the attack and anything special that happens in it. This will be explained in more detail in the tutorial.<BR><LI><FONT COLOR="red" FACE="arial">Attack Damage</FONT>-This tells the damage done to your opponent's Pokémon with the attack.

If there is a circle here, it is a Common card; these are easily found; you get 7 per booster pack. If there is a diamond, it is an Uncommon; these are more sought after; you get 3 per booster pack. If there is a star, it is a Rare; these are the most wanted (and most expensive) cards, there is only 1 per booster pack.<BR><LI><FONT COLOR="red" FACE="arial">Card Number</FONT>-What number the card is. The cards are organized by rarity, then by alphabetical order. I use the number to organize the cards in my binder.
