# PokeCards

This is an archive of one of the first websites I built; it was active between 1998 and 2000.
I was 15 at the time.

I've preserved it here for posterity and a love of all things Quirks Mode.

It's hosted at http://d.matthew-steele.com/pokemon/

The original site is still kicking at http://www.pokecards.8m.com. Be prepared for popups and banners beyond your wildest imaginations.
