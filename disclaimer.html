All over this website you will find images, articles, and other information that could easily be copied from this website to another. However, much (if not all) of the information was set up exclusively by me, and this took a lot of time (say over 20 man-hours). Because I spent a lot of time putting together PokéCards, I do not think that it is right for someone to just mosey on into my site, steal information, and claim it as their own. As a matter of fact, that is illegal. There is no free speech on the 'Net. Therefore, if someone steals anything from my website that I can legally claim as originally mine, I <B>will</B> pursue legal action. Feel free to use the images on your computer; however, I will not tolerate liars and thiefs.<BR>However, since I did not make the images on the Jungle Pokédex, you may use the <B>thumbnail</B> images (not the full-size ones) as long as you give credit to PokéCards. Thank you.<HR><BR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial" COLOR="red">Other Legal Information</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="2">Pokémon, P: TCG, and all the Pokémon names are trademark of Nintendo, Gamefreak, and Wizards of the Coast.
